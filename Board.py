# This object creates a virtual "board" for the puzzle to sit on. 
# It uses the width and height to create a perimeter so that we know how big the puzzle is for framing.
# It also calculates how wide and tall each piece is according to the number of pieces and the overall area.
# Calls the piece object to create pieces and store them in a piece lookup
# saves the puzzle and piece dictionary in a CSV file by ID numbers and a picture of the overall pattern by the same name as the ID number.
